// Question: There is a N-storey building indexed from 1 to N in front of you, you get K eggs (K >= 1). It is determined that this building has floor F (0 <= F <= N), you drop an egg down from this floor and the egg just wonâ€™t be broken (the floors above F will break, and the floors below F won't break). Now, in the worst case, how many times at least do you need to throw the eggs to determine what floor is this floor F on?
